Quantum Walks have a vast amount of applications in the current landscape of algorithm design. In this paper we analyze a specific implementation of a Quantum Walk, the Staggered Quantum Walk using the ZX-calculus. While conducting this analysis we discovered a possible alternative evolution operator for the Staggered Quantum Walk, that utilizes a much smaller amount of gates and can also be used in QPUs with limited qubit connectivity.
