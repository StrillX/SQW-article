The quantum equivalents of classical random walks are known as quantum walks. 
Much like the classical random walks, quantum random walks can be both discrete or continuous. 
In a classical random walk, the walker exists in definite states, and stochastic state transitions are what cause the unpredictability. In a quantum random walk this randomness emerges from the superposition of quantum states, unitary evolution and state measurements. The particular quantum walk that this work focuses on is the Staggered Quantum Walk.

Much like classical random walks which have proven to be a very powerful tool in the development of stochastic algorithms \cite{stochastic-algos,ksat}, quantum walks are a state-of-the-art tool for constructing quantum algorithms. The range of the applications of quantum walks is vast and with a large set of open problems \cite{QW-overview}.
