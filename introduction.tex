The quantum equivalents of classical random walks are known as quantum walks. 
Much like the classical random walks, quantum random walks can be both discrete or continuous. 
In a classical random walk, the walker exists in definite states, and stochastic state transitions are what cause the unpredictability. In a quantum random walk this randomness emerges from the superposition of quantum states, unitary evolution and state measurements.

The ZX-calculus is used to reason about quantum computation in the form of a graphical language. These computations are represented by string diagrams, commonly referred to as ZX-diagrams.
